JARVIS Fashion AI App – High-Fidelity UI Design
JARVIS is a modern fashion-tech app that connects all stages of a garment’s journey – from design concept to a user’s wardrobe. The UI will be organized into a 3-tab mobile layout: a collaborative Feed timeline, an interactive Design Studio, and a personalized User Profile. The design emphasizes a mobile-first approach, ensuring key features are optimized for small screens before scaling up uxpin.com. The visual style follows the app’s 3D bowtie logo branding – a sleek red & black primary palette with rounded elements and soft shadows for a friendly yet upscale feel. This “soft UI” aesthetic (inspired by neumorphism) uses rounded corners and subtle depth to create an inviting, cohesive look webdesignerdepot.com. Consistent typography and iconography will be used across all tabs, and content will be presented in clean card-based layouts – an approach that keeps the interface attractive and easy to scan on mobile devices ux.stackexchange.com. Example fashion content (fabric swatches, outfit photos, design sketches, etc.) will be included throughout to make the prototype feel realistic. The following sections detail the UI of each tab and the overall design system for a shareable high-fidelity Figma file (styled for React Native/Expo implementation).

Feed Tab: Fashion Lifecycle Timeline
The Feed Tab is designed as a visual timeline of posts that chronicles the end-to-end lifecycle of fashion items. It aggregates updates from all user roles – User, Designer, Tailor, Fabric Retailer, and Readymade Retailer – into one scrollable feed. Each post appears as a card containing rich media (photos, sketches, or 3D previews) and text, with clear labeling of the role and stage. The posts are arranged chronologically and visually connected to represent progression: for example, a designer’s initial sketch post links to the tailor’s garment construction post, which links to the user’s photo wearing the finished item. A subtle vertical timeline indicator (a line or chain of dots) runs alongside the feed to connect related posts in sequence, helping users track events in order uinkits.com. This gives a narrative flow – users can literally see a garment move from concept to completion as they scroll. Post Card Design: Each feed item is a polished card with a slight corner radius and shadow, aligning with the soft UI style. The card displays the poster’s name and role (with a small role tag or icon, e.g. a pencil icon for Designer, a needle for Tailor) at the top, so users immediately recognize the context. The main content could be an image or video (e.g. a designer’s sketch, a fabric swatch, a work-in-progress photo from a tailor, a finished product shot, or a user wearing the outfit). Below the image, a short description or status update is shown (for instance, “Designer Alice: New evening gown sketch ready!” or “Tailor Bob: Dress is now stitched and awaiting fitting.”). If a post is part of a lifecycle chain, the card may include a nested preview or link to the next stage: for example, the designer’s post might have a small thumbnail of the tailor’s post or an arrow indicating “Next: Tailor update”. Tapping a post could expand a detailed view or the full timeline of that item’s lifecycle. Connected Lifecycle UI: To emphasize the product lifecycle linkage, connected posts can be shown with a vertical connector line on the left side of the cards. For instance, the first post (e.g. a fabric retailer showcasing a new fabric) might have a starting dot, the next related post (designer uses that fabric in a sketch) is connected by a line, then the tailor’s post, and so on until the user’s outfit post (end of chain marked by a terminator symbol). Visually, this could look like a vertical stepper or timeline, but instead of just labels it’s actual posts at each step. This gives the feed a unique storyboard feel. Users can follow the thread of a garment: e.g., Fabric → Design → Tailoring → Retail/Outfit. If posts are not part of any chain, they simply appear as individual cards (with no connector line). The timeline approach leverages familiar UX patterns (similar to order tracking or project timelines) to help users navigate sequences uinkits.com, but here it’s applied in a social feed context. Role-Based Filters: At the top of the Feed, include a filter bar to let users refine the content by role, post type, or status. This can be implemented as a horizontal set of toggle chips (e.g. “👗 Designer”, “🧵 Tailor”, “🏬 Retailer”, “📸 User”) that act as filters. Tapping “Designer” would show only design sketch posts; “Tailor” shows tailoring updates, etc. Additional filter chips or a dropdown might allow filtering by status or lifecycle stage (e.g. “Idea”, “In-Progress”, “Completed”). The filter bar will use the brand colors for the active selection (for example, a chip highlighting in red when active). This helps users tailor their feed view, especially as the content grows. Nested Post Previews: When a post has related previous or next posts, the card itself can hint at them. For example, a “View Progress” button or thumbnail strip may appear at the bottom of a designer’s post if a tailor has already posted the next stage. Similarly, a tailor’s completion post might show a small image of the original sketch (previous stage) and of the final user outfit (next stage) as an interactive element (tapping these could jump to that post’s detail). These visual cues invite exploration and keep the lifecycle narrative clear. Consistent Interaction Elements: Each post card can include standard social actions (e.g. a heart icon to like, comment bubble, and share button) if social engagement is desired. These icons should be subtle (perhaps grey or black) to not overpower the content. They would be placed consistently (e.g. bottom of the card). Even if the primary goal is following the product journey, allowing users to appreciate and discuss posts could increase engagement. (If the app’s focus is purely on lifecycle tracking, these could be optional). In any case, tapping a post should lead to a detailed view with the full content, larger images, and the ability to scroll through that item’s entire timeline. The Feed Tab overall uses a scrollable vertical layout familiar to users, but enriched with the timeline connectors and role indicators. By combining a card-based feed (easy to scan, mobile-friendly ux.stackexchange.com) with a chronological timeline concept, the design ensures users can quickly catch up on updates and also deep-dive into the story of each fashion item. All UI components here (post cards, role tags, filter chips, connectors) will be built as reusable Figma components so that the style remains uniform across posts and easily adjustable.

Design Studio Tab: Creative & Shopping Experience
The Design Studio Tab is the heart of JARVIS, where the user engages in creative exploration, virtual try-ons, and shopping. This section functions as a comprehensive interface for avatar customization, virtual outfit try-ons, mix-and-match custom designs, and order processing. It’s essentially a mini design ecosystem within the app, so the UI will be organized into sub-sections or screens accessible from a main Studio landing page or menu. We’ll ensure a consistent look and feel across these sub-tools, so it feels like one integrated studio. Key features and their UI design:

Avatar Setup & Customization
Upon entering the Design Studio, the user’s virtual avatar is front and center – this avatar represents the user’s body for try-ons. The Avatar Setup screen lets users create and fine-tune their 3D avatar. The UI will likely display a 3D model mannequin of the user (front and possibly 3/4 view) on the majority of the screen, with controls beneath or overlaying for customization. Users can input or adjust body measurements (height, chest, waist, etc.), either via sliders, stepper inputs, or a guided form. For a high-fashion feel, the measurement interface can be stylized (e.g. a tape measure icon for measurements, an outline of a body with adjustable markers). We’ll use straightforward form components for entering numbers, but also consider a more visual approach: for example, dragging a slider might subtly morph the avatar’s body shape in real-time. Avatar customization might also include selecting a base face, skin tone, or hairstyle to personalize the look. A small preview thumbnail of the avatar could be shown next to measurement fields to highlight which part is being adjusted. The Save Avatar button (in the app’s signature red color for emphasis) is fixed at the bottom, so after changes the user can save and see the updated avatar. This avatar setup interface will be visually clean and encouraging – likely a light background to let the avatar model stand out, with the primary accents (red/black buttons and text) guiding the user’s eye to actions. We will incorporate helpful microcopy, e.g., “Your avatar will be used for virtual try-on. Ensure measurements are accurate for best fit.” Once the avatar is configured, the user can proceed to try on clothes virtually with confidence that the proportions match their real self. (This feature aligns with modern virtual fitting trends – apps now let users try outfits on a personalized avatar for precise sizing dribbble.com.)

Virtual Try-On Zone
The Try-On Zone is a virtual fitting room where users can browse and try on various fashion items in three categories: Ready-to-Wear, Custom Designs, and Designer Sketches. The UI will make it easy to switch between these sub-categories, likely using a segmented control or toggle at the top of this screen. For example, a horizontal selector with three tabs: “Ready-to-Wear”, “Custom”, and “Sketches”. Tapping each filters the content below.

Ready-to-Wear: This section shows catalog items from retailers (standard clothing that can be bought off the rack). The UI is akin to a shopping app: a scrollable grid or carousel of product cards, each with a photo of the garment on a generic model or on a hanger, plus name and price. For a high-fidelity design, we’ll use realistic product photos (dresses, shirts, etc.) as example content. When a user taps an item, it opens the Try-On viewer: the screen splits to show the user’s avatar on top (now wearing the selected item) and item details below. The avatar view could allow rotation (perhaps a rotate icon or swipe gesture to turn the avatar) so the user can see the fit from different angles. The item details panel shows size options, price, description, and action buttons (Buy, Save, Share). The primary call-to-action (Buy) will be highlighted in red. The “Save” button adds the item to the user’s Wardrobe or wishlist; “Share” might create a snapshot of the avatar in that outfit to share with friends. The virtual try-on technology gives users a sense of how the clothing looks on their body model, increasing purchase confidence (a feature increasingly common in fashion apps dribbble.com).

Custom Design: In this mode, users can try on outfits that are made-to-order or customizable. The UI might present a list of base designs or templates (e.g. a basic blazer, a gown silhouette, a pair of trousers) possibly illustrated or shown as 3D renders. Each design card might include an icon indicating it’s customizable (e.g. a pencil or tweak icon). When selected, the Try-On viewer again shows the avatar wearing a default version of that design. The user can then customize aspects – for instance, select a different fabric or color. The UI can provide options like “Choose Fabric” which opens a swatch picker (a grid of fabric thumbnail images), or “Adjust Fit” for things like sleeve length, etc. However, detailed customization is largely covered by the Mix & Match Engine (described next), so the Custom Design try-on may simply link to that engine for deeper customization. Still, the user can see a quick preview of a design on their avatar here and decide to proceed to customizing fully or ordering as-is. The design detail view will have a “Customize” button (leading to the Mix & Match flow) alongside Buy/Save. Essentially, Custom Design Try-On serves as a discovery area for user-created or designer-uploaded pieces that can be tailor-made.

Designer Sketches: This unique section lets users explore concept sketches or lookbook images from designers. The UI could resemble a Pinterest-style board or an Instagram feed of gorgeous sketches, fashion illustrations, or runway photos. Tapping a sketch opens a detail view where the user might not directly “try on” the sketch (since it’s just an illustration), but they can express interest or vote on it, or see if similar items are available. We might incorporate a feature where if a sketch is popular, the system might have a corresponding design ready to try or a recommended similar style. For the prototype, tapping a sketch could show the full image and a description by the designer (e.g. inspiration, materials intended). If the sketch is linked to a real item (once produced by a tailor or retailer), the UI might show a “Try Similar” button that loads a garment if available. This section is more inspirational and community-driven, allowing users to engage with designers’ creative process. Visually, it will use a gallery layout of cards with sketch artwork, each card labeled with the design name and designer. Role tags (Designer) will appear here too, possibly with a unique color or icon to denote concept stage.

Across all these categories, the Try-On Zone maintains a consistent layout: a browsing area and a viewer for the avatar try-on. Navigation should be intuitive – e.g., a back arrow to return to the category list from any item view. The Mix & Match and Buy/Save/Share functions are integrated so that from any try-on item, the user can either purchase it, save it, or further customize it.

Mix & Match Engine (Fabric + Design + Tailor)
The Mix & Match Engine is a powerful feature that enables users to create a custom garment by combining choices of fabric, design style, and tailor. The UI for this will likely be a multi-step wizard or an interactive configurator screen. One approach is a step-by-step flow:

Select Design – The user chooses a base design or style first (e.g. dress, jacket, trousers). This could be presented as a horizontal list of illustrated icons (dress icon, jacket icon, etc.) or a grid of example silhouettes. Selecting one highlights it (with a red outline or checkmark). A “Next” button moves to step 2.

Select Fabric – Now the user picks the material. Show a grid of fabric swatches (small cards or circles showing texture/pattern), possibly pulled from the Fabric Retailer posts or library. Users can tap a swatch to see it applied to the chosen design on a small preview of the garment (e.g. a mini avatar or just a garment render). If the fabric has variants (colorways), allow filtering or a sub-selection. The UI here might use a carousal or a modal for fabric details (with a larger preview and info like fabric composition).

Select Tailor – Finally, the user selects a tailor or maker who will construct the garment. This can be shown as a list of tailor profiles, each as a card with a profile picture, name, rating, and maybe estimated cost or timeframe. Alternatively, the app might auto-assign a tailor based on availability and user’s location; in that case, step 3 could be confirmation rather than selection. But if user choice is allowed, they tap a tailor card to select. A small profile popup could give more info on that tailor (experience, reviews).

These steps could also be presented on one scrollable screen with sections for Design, Fabric, Tailor – especially on larger phones – allowing quick back-and-forth changes. But a step wizard ensures the user focuses on one decision at a time. We’ll decide based on clarity; a step indicator at the top (e.g. “Design > Fabric > Tailor”) will show progress. After choices are made, the 3D Preview is generated: the user’s avatar (or a mannequin) is shown wearing the custom combination. This preview appears on a summary screen titled something like “Preview Your Design”. The garment should reflect the chosen silhouette and fabric pattern. If real-time 3D is complex, at least a static rendered image is shown. The user can rotate or zoom the view if possible, to inspect details. Beneath the preview, a summary of selections (design name, fabric name, tailor selected) is listed, along with an estimated price and delivery time. At this stage, key action buttons are provided: “Order Now” (primary action, in red), “Save Design” (to save this combination in their wardrobe or favorites), and “Share” (perhaps to share a snapshot of this custom design with friends or on social media). The share feature could be fun, letting the user show off their creation. Upon tapping “Order Now”, the user goes through the purchase flow (confirm measurements, address, payment – likely a separate flow, but since we’re focusing on UI design, we assume a standard checkout modal or screen sequence appears, which we will design consistently with the app’s style). The Mix & Match UI will utilize reusable components like the swatch cards and profile cards. We’ll ensure the experience remains smooth and visual – lots of images for fabrics and design previews so the user always sees what their choices look like. This empowers creativity: the user is effectively a co-designer, and the app’s interface should make this fun and intuitive. (The novelty of combining fabric + design + tailor is a core selling point of JARVIS.) We also plan to include smart defaults and validations – e.g., only show fabrics that are suitable for the chosen design, or if a tailor is selected first, show designs they specialize in, etc., to avoid impossible combinations. Those details might be beyond the static design, but we note them for completeness.

Order Processing Timeline
Once an order is placed (whether it’s a custom Mix&Match order or a ready-to-wear purchase), users will want to track its progress. The Design Studio Tab includes an Order Processing Timeline feature – effectively an order status tracker. This might live on the main Studio page as a “My Orders” button or section, or possibly it transitions the user to the Profile’s order area. But since it’s mentioned here, we’ll design a timeline view for orders. The Order Timeline Screen will list each active order with a collapsible timeline of stages. For a given order (say a custom dress), the timeline might have steps like: Order Placed → In Design → With Tailor → Quality Check → Shipped → Delivered. Each stage would be represented with an icon and label, and the current stage highlighted (e.g. current stage in red or with a pulsing dot). Similar to typical package tracking UIs, completed stages have a checkmark or filled icon, upcoming stages are greyed out. If the user taps the order, it expands to show more details at each stage (dates, maybe messages from the tailor or designer). We’ll design this timeline with the app’s aesthetic in mind: possibly using the vertical timeline component similar to the Feed, but focused on time progression. Clear visual cues help the user see where their item is in production. (Using a timeline UI for tracking events is very user-friendly uinkits.com.) We can integrate this screen with notifications – e.g., a small badge on the Design Studio tab icon could alert when a stage is updated. In the UI, an “Updates” pill or a colored dot next to “Processing Timeline” menu item can hint if there’s new progress. Once an order is delivered, that timeline could either move to a history section or show as completed. From a navigation perspective, the user might access this timeline either through the Design Studio tab (e.g., a prominent “Track My Order” button on the main page if an order is in progress), or via the Profile Orders section. We will ensure the design accounts for both entry points but keep one canonical design for the timeline itself.

Buy, Save, and Share Options
Throughout the Design Studio, at key points where the user is viewing a product or design, they will have the options to Buy, Save, or Share. Ensuring these actions are consistently placed and styled is crucial for a seamless experience:

Buy/Order: The primary action (buying or ordering an item) will usually appear as a prominent button in the interface, colored in the app’s primary red for visibility. For example, on a product detail or preview screen, a red bottom bar or floating button labeled “Buy Now” or “Order Now” will catch the eye. We’ll use a full-width button at the bottom of the screen for clarity on mobile – this is a common pattern for e-commerce apps to have the checkout button fixed at bottom. It will use large, legible text and maybe an icon like a shopping bag or credit card to reinforce the action.

Save: The save action (bookmarking an outfit, saving a design for later) will be represented by a heart or bookmark icon. In many fashion apps, a heart icon toggle in the corner of an item image is used. We can do similar: e.g., in the try-on list, each item card could have a small heart icon to save without opening it. On detail screens, a “Save” button (often an outline heart that fills in on tap) could sit next to or near the Buy button. Saved items go to My Wardrobe in the profile tab. We’ll ensure that when the user taps Save, some feedback is shown (icon fill or a toast saying “Added to Wardrobe”).

Share: The share option will use the standard share icon (an arrow or three-dot connected graph symbol). This might be placed in a top-right app bar on detail pages (common for sharing a product page) or next to Buy/Save as a secondary action. Sharing could allow the user to send a link or an image of the outfit. For design, perhaps the app generates a stylish snapshot of their avatar in that outfit to share. While we don’t design the entire share flow, we’ll include the icon and assume it triggers the native share sheet.

Placement example: On an item preview screen (avatar + item details), we might have a bottom action bar with three icons: Add to Wardrobe (Save), Share, and a central Buy Now button, each icon labeled. Or we use a combination: a prominent Buy button and smaller icons in the header for save/share. We will test which arrangement feels more balanced in the layout and use Figma’s prototyping to simulate it.

Smart AI Style Suggestions
To leverage JARVIS’s AI capabilities, the Design Studio will also offer Smart Suggestions – personalized recommendations for the user. This could be a section on the main Design Studio landing screen, for example a horizontally scrollable row of recommended outfits or a panel titled “Just For You”. The suggestions are generated based on the user’s style preferences, body profile, current trends, and even location (for climate or cultural relevance). In terms of UI, one approach is a carousel of cards: each card might show an outfit suggestion (either an image of a complete look, or the user’s avatar wearing a proposed outfit, if the system can generate that). The card could have a title like “Street Casual – Rainy Day” or “Evening Formal Look” to give context. Swiping through the carousel shows different suggestions (maybe 5-10 recommendations). Tapping a suggestion opens a detail where the user can see the items in that outfit (with options to try them on or buy them). We will style these suggestion cards to stand out slightly (perhaps a softer background or a distinct border) so users notice the AI input. Since these are AI-curated, an info icon could explain “Why this suggestion?” indicating it's based on their profile (e.g. “Recommended for you based on your saved styles and current trends”). This fosters trust in the AI stylist. Modern AI stylist apps indeed provide outfit ideas tailored to a user’s preferences and body type dribbble.com, so we mirror that functionality. For example, if the user often wears bohemian styles, the suggestions will reflect that with a modern twist, labeled accordingly. Additionally, we can have contextual suggestions: if the user is currently looking at a floral summer dress in the try-on, the app might show “You may also like these items” beneath, or “Complete the look” suggestions (like matching shoes or accessories from retailers). This can be designed as smaller thumbnail cards with product images, which the user can tap to view. Overall, the Design Studio tab will likely have a landing/dashboard screen that summarises these sections: a banner or quick link to Avatar Setup, a section or icon for Try-On (possibly jumping into the last used category or a default category), an icon for Mix & Match to start designing from scratch, and a panel for Suggestions as described. We’ll ensure the navigation within this tab is clear – possibly using a bottom navbar specific to sub-sections or a simple scrollable page with anchors to each section. Given the complexity, using separate screens with a menu might be cleaner: e.g., a bottom-sheet menu or a floating menu button (maybe a stylized “+” or wardrobe icon) that lets user choose between Avatar, Try-On, Mix & Match, etc., rather than one giant scrolling page. In Figma, we can prototype it both ways to see which feels more intuitive, but the final design will aim for discoverability of all features without overwhelming the user. Styling in the Design Studio will stay consistent with the rest of the app: rounded cards, cohesive icons, and the red/black color highlights. Despite many features, using a consistent design language (buttons, cards, lists) will make it feel unified. We’ll also leverage AI assistant hints – perhaps a Jarvis chatbot or an AI assistant icon could be present to guide the user (for example, a floating chat icon that says “Need help deciding? Ask Jarvis!”). This is optional, but it could enhance the futuristic feel. If included, its UI would be minimal to not distract. By providing avatar-based try-on, custom design mixing, and smart suggestions in one place, the Design Studio tab becomes a one-stop creative hub. Our Figma design will include all these sub-screens and demonstrate the user flow between them (e.g., from a suggestion to try-on, to mix & match, to order tracking) via prototype links.

User Profile Tab: Personal Hub and Settings
The User Profile Tab is the user’s personal hub for all their account information, saved items, and past interactions. It combines the utility of account management with a snapshot of the user’s fashion activities. The design will present this info in a clear, sectioned layout, likely as a scrollable profile page with distinct panels or menu options for each category (Avatar, Wardrobe, Orders, etc.). At the very top, we’ll have a Profile Header. This could include the user’s name or handle, and perhaps a profile picture or avatar preview. Since the user has a 3D avatar, we might render a small avatar portrait (maybe a front-view of their avatar’s face or full body) in a circular frame. Next to it, their basic info can be shown (username, or a fun title like “Fashion Explorer”). Possibly an edit icon on the avatar picture to quickly jump to Avatar Setup (redundant with the section below but convenient). The header area sets a personal tone – we might also include a background banner with a subtle fashion-themed graphic or the bowtie logo translucent, to brand the page. Below the header, the profile screen is divided into sections:

Avatar & Measurements Management
This section allows the user to review and edit their avatar and body data. It might appear as a card or list item labeled “👤 My Avatar & Measurements”. If space allows, we can show a mini preview: e.g., a small full-body silhouette of the avatar with key measurements listed (height, etc.), or just a line of text like “Avatar: 5’8” Medium Build – Edit”. Tapping this goes to the Avatar Setup screen (the same one accessible via Design Studio). To make it seamless, we’ll ensure that the Avatar Setup is a shared component – editing can be initiated from either place. The design should give a cue that this is important for getting good fit (maybe a subtitle: “Ensure your measurements are up to date for accurate try-ons”). The icon and wording should be approachable, possibly an icon of a person or a dress form.

My Wardrobe (Saved & Completed Outfits)
“My Wardrobe” is where all the user’s saved items and completed purchases/outfits reside – essentially a digital closet. This section can be presented as an array of item thumbnails. We might give it a slight gallery feel. For example, it could show a two-column grid of square cards, each showing an item or outfit image. The first few saved looks might be previewed right on the profile screen to entice clicks (e.g., show 4 items with a “View All (12)” button/link to a dedicated Wardrobe screen). If space is tight, simply a list item with an icon of a wardrobe and text “My Wardrobe (12 items)” which navigates to the Wardrobe gallery screen might suffice. On the dedicated Wardrobe screen, we’ll have tabs or filters to toggle between “Saved Outfits” and “Purchased Items” (or “My Designs” if they’ve custom-made some). The Saved category includes anything the user bookmarked (ready-to-wear items, liked designer sketches, or mix & match designs saved). These would appear as cards with an image, name, and maybe a tag indicating source (e.g. “Design by Alice” or “From Mix&Match”). The Completed category shows items the user owns – either delivered custom items or purchased ready-made. These could similarly show a photo (perhaps the user’s own photo if they uploaded one wearing it, or the product photo if not). It’s essentially a history of their fashion acquisitions. For each, actions might include “Reorder” (if applicable), “Share Look” (maybe post it to the Feed as a user post), or “Details” (show order info). We will incorporate example content like a few clothing images to illustrate a filled wardrobe. The design will use card components here as well, maintaining consistency. For visual appeal, we might allow a cover image or highlight for favorite outfit: e.g., a slightly larger card at top for a “favorite look of the day”. But that’s an enhancement; core is a clean gallery of saved items. Having a digital wardrobe aligns with the idea of an AI stylist – many apps offer a virtual closet to mix-and-match outfits. In JARVIS, this ties back to the AI suggestions and design studio. (Notably, AI fashion apps often let users manage their wardrobe and get outfit suggestions dribbble.com dribbble.com; JARVIS’s Wardrobe will similarly empower the user to plan looks and use saved pieces in new mix-and-match sessions.)

Orders & Processing Timeline
This section provides access to order history and tracking. It can be listed as “📦 My Orders & Tracking” on the profile page. We’ll show a brief summary here – for instance, if an order is in progress, display something like “1 Active Order – Tailor in Progress” as a subtext, so the user is informed at a glance. Completed orders count can also be mentioned (e.g. “5 past orders”). Tapping this goes to the Orders screen, which could list orders by most recent. Each order entry would show an order ID or name (maybe the item name, like “Custom Red Dress”), date, and status. If an order is active, it might show a progress bar or status label (“In Transit”, “Delivered on Aug 10”, etc.). The user can tap an order to view its processing timeline in detail (this would be the same timeline view described in the Design Studio section). We will ensure the timeline design is reused here – likely just navigate to that timeline screen. For consistency, the timeline might actually live under Profile in terms of Figma pages, but accessible from both tabs. We’ll pay attention to making the order list legible and not too dense: use cards or list rows with ample spacing, maybe an accordion style to reveal timeline inline. Icons can represent order status (e.g. a checkmark for delivered, a truck for shipped, a needle for in tailoring, etc.). The primary color (red) can highlight important statuses or the order name.

Addresses & Payment Methods
This covers account settings for commerce. Likely, we present it as two separate options on the profile page: “🏠 Addresses” and “💳 Payment Methods”. These would lead to simple form screens where users can add/edit their shipping addresses and credit card or payment info. The UI for those screens should be straightforward: form fields with proper labels, a consistent form style (which might be reused from avatar measurements input style for consistency). Perhaps we use a card layout with each address listed and an edit icon, or a plus button to add a new one. Payment could list cards on file with the last 4 digits and an icon (Visa, etc.), plus add new. We will ensure secure iconography and perhaps a note like “Your payment info is encrypted & secure” to build trust, although that’s textual. On the main profile, if space is an issue, we might combine these into one “Account & Settings” section that includes addresses, payments, and other settings. But since the prompt lists them, we’ll keep them distinct for clarity. We will use standard icons (house for address, card for payment) to make them easily recognizable.

App Settings
At the bottom of the profile can be a generic “Settings” option (gear icon). This would include preferences like notification toggles, privacy settings, help, about, etc. We might not flesh out all these in the design, but it’s standard to have. If designing a Settings screen, we’ll use a typical list of toggles and sub-menu items, matching the app style (with perhaps a switch component styled in the red theme for on-state). Navigation & Layout: The profile tab likely uses a scrollable list of sections as described. Another common pattern is a settings menu style (like iOS Settings app or many profile screens) where each item is a row with an icon, title, and maybe a chevron indicating tap to open. We could list: My Avatar, My Wardrobe, My Orders, Addresses, Payment, Settings (and maybe Support/FAQ, etc if needed). This list approach is very clear and compact. Alternatively, we could make the profile more visual – e.g., cards for Wardrobe and Orders showing some content preview. A hybrid approach: top part visual (avatar and maybe a horizontal list of wardrobe items), then a list for other settings. We will likely opt for a clean list with icons for the various sections (since that’s easy to scan and consistent). Each icon will use the same style (line icons or filled, chosen to match the overall aesthetic). The color scheme here will probably be a light background with dark text, using red only for emphasis (e.g., delete account button in red, or notification switch accent). It should feel calm and user-friendly, as it’s more of a utility section compared to the visually rich Feed and Studio. Since the Profile tab is where personal data is managed, we must ensure elements like buttons (Save changes, etc.) are clearly visible. Any critical info (like if profile is incomplete or if an order needs attention) could be highlighted at the top. For example, if measurements are missing, a banner might say “Complete your avatar for better fit suggestions!” with a link – adding such a dynamic prompt can improve user experience. We’ll illustrate one such example in the design (maybe a subtle info banner). Finally, the profile will include the necessary sign-out or delete account option likely at bottom or in settings, but that’s minor. The main goal is to make the user feel in control of their data and content. Reusing components like list rows, buttons, and cards here (which we established in Feed and Studio) will maintain a harmonious look.

Design System and Figma Organization
To ensure a high-fidelity and developer-friendly design, we will establish a design system in Figma with reusable components and styles, and organize the file for clarity:

Color & Typography Styles: We’ll define global styles for the primary colors (e.g., a vibrant red for accents, black or charcoal for text, a range of grays for backgrounds and borders, and maybe a secondary color if needed). Text styles for headers, subheaders, body text, labels, etc., will be set up (likely a clean sans-serif font for modern look, maybe a fashion-styled font for headers if it fits, but readability is key). These styles ensure consistency when applied across all screens, and if the brand tweaks a color, we update it once to reflect everywhere figma.com.

Reusable Components: In Figma, we will create components for UI elements that repeat. For example: Post Card, Role Tag Badge, Avatar Preview Widget, Product Card, Button styles, Icons, Timeline Item, Nav Bar etc. Components let us design systematically; if we need to adjust a component (say change the corner radius on cards), it updates across all instances figma.com. We’ll also use variants for components where appropriate (e.g., a Button could have variants: Primary (red) vs Secondary (outline), or a Card could have variants for different roles color accent). This systematic approach not only speeds up design but ensures a uniform look and feel in the final product.

Layouts and Spacing: The design will use a 4px or 8px grid for spacing to align with common mobile design practices, making it easier to implement in React Native. All margins, paddings, and element sizes will adhere to this grid for visual harmony. We will also consider safe area spacing for top/bottom content (accounting for status bar and iPhone notch areas). Using Figma’s auto-layout feature for lists and cards will help demonstrate responsive behavior (e.g., how a feed card might expand if text is longer).

Iconography: We’ll use a consistent icon set (perhaps Material Design icons or a custom line icon pack that matches the aesthetic). All icons will be converted to components as well. The red-black palette might be applied: for instance, icons might mostly be black or gray, with occasional red highlights for active states.

Tab Bar Design: As this is a 3-tab app, we’ll design the bottom tab bar with appropriate icons for each tab (Feed, Studio, Profile) and labels. The active tab will be highlighted in red (or with a red underline/dot and label in red) while inactive tabs are black or gray. The tab bar will have a slight shadow (to separate it from content) and use the same rounded feel (perhaps rounded corners if we give it a shape, though usually it spans full width). We ensure this is fixed at bottom in all relevant screen designs.

Prototype Links and Pages: The Figma file will be organized into pages per major section. We will create at least three pages: Feed, Design Studio, and Profile, each containing the artboards (frames) for the respective tab’s screens and flows. This separation makes it easy to focus on one section at a time, and is recommended for organizing different user flows help.figma.com. Each page will have an initial screen marked as the flow starting point for prototyping. For example, on the Feed page, the main timeline screen is the start; on the Studio page, maybe the Studio dashboard is the start; on Profile page, the profile main screen is the start. We will use Figma’s prototyping connectors to link interactive elements to their target screens: e.g., clicking a post in Feed goes to a detailed post view (which might be another frame), clicking the filter might open a filter modal frame, or from Profile tapping "My Orders" goes to the orders frame, etc. This allows the Figma prototype to be a clickable demo of the app’s primary flows.

Flow Annotations: We will label the flows (Figma allows flow names) such that reviewers can easily run, say, the “Feed scrolling flow” or “End-to-end order flow”. Clear naming and maybe arrows or user journey notes on the canvas can illustrate how the user would navigate. For instance, we might annotate: “1️⃣ User browses Feed and taps a design post → 2️⃣ Jumps to Design Studio Try-On of that design → 3️⃣ Saves outfit and goes to Profile Wardrobe.”

Developer Handoff Considerations: Since the design is intended for React Native with Expo, we’ll ensure that we follow platform UI conventions where applicable (like tap sizes, iOS vs Android differences minimal since we aim for a custom look but we won’t violate basic navigation patterns). We might include in the Figma file a reference artboard with the design system and notes (e.g., color hex values, font sizes in dp/sp, spacing units) which developers can refer to. The design assets (icons, images) will be exportable. Using components in Figma also hints at React Native components structure (for example, a PostCard component in design could translate to a reusable component in code). This alignment can streamline the handoff.

Example Content and Images: We will not link to external images in the final deliverable, but rather embed them in the Figma file for fidelity. Lower-resolution images of fabrics, clothes, and sketches as mentioned will be sufficient for the prototype. Each image layer will be properly masked or clipped to the card shapes. All text will be real-looking (no lorem ipsum, we’ll use contextually appropriate text for authenticity).

Aesthetic Consistency: We recall that rounded corners and deep yet soft shadows define the aesthetic, per the bowtie logo’s style cues. We’ll apply this consistently: cards and modals will have slightly rounded edges (maybe 12px radius) and a gentle shadow (e.g., y-offset 2, blur 4, small opacity) to make them lift from the background without harshness. As referenced in soft UI design principles, this creates a friendly, cohesive look webdesignerdepot.com. However, we will be mindful of contrast and usability – text will still be high contrast (likely black on white) for readability, avoiding the pitfalls of too-light neumorphism. Buttons will be clearly delineated (solid fills for primary actions) so that the app remains accessible and easy to use.

In summary, the high-fidelity Figma UI for the JARVIS fashion AI app will be a comprehensive, well-structured design encompassing a rich Feed timeline, an innovative Design Studio, and a personal Profile area. By using a mobile-first approach and a consistent design language, we ensure the app is intuitive and visually engaging on small screens uxpin.com. The use of systematic components and styles will make the design scalable and maintainable as the project grows figma.com. All screens will be interconnected via prototype links, effectively demonstrating user flows across the Feed, creation studio, and profile management. Once completed, the Figma file can be easily shared (e.g., via a Figma share link) with developers and stakeholders. Developers can refer to the pixel-perfect layouts, and even leverage Figma-to-React Native tools if desired, since our design sticks to standard UI patterns that convert well. Through this design, JARVIS will offer a seamless experience merging social updates, AI-driven creativity dribbble.com, and e-commerce functionality, all wrapped in a modern, brand-consistent interface. The final deliverable is not just a set of pretty screens, but a thought-out blueprint of the user experience, ready to be prototyped in Figma and implemented in React Native/Expo for users to enjoy.
